# üö®Disclamer

This is a toy version of the lisp interpreter implemented by ***"fuck around and find out"*** with claude, 

discussing the approach and implementing it, 

I don't expect all the complex features to work nor the code to be optimal like a actual interpreter built by someone who knows this stuff, 

this was made for fun as a side project but I'll try to rewrite it when I am more knowledgable about this.

# Zisp - A Toy Lisp Interpreter in Zig

**Zisp** is a minimalistic Lisp interpreter crafted with **Zig**. 

This project was started because after reaching 58/109 exercises in ziglings, I got overwhelmed with the theory part,

But after beginning to lose interest I remembered that i was ***the*** top guy and cannot give up like this,

Having a low attention span and not having read ~10 pages of something in one sitting in past 8 years, im as good as a illiterate, 

educational videos too bore me.

So I decided to rawdog Claude with a series of "fuck around and find out" and started to build this, 

Since I'm getting results so I'll keep cooking

### üö®**Zisp Highlights**
![zesty-sonic-zesty](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36448efb-f70e-4f56-a648-2d7dbf520a4e)

- **AST:** Hierarchical structure for Lisp expressions, with support for special forms.
- **Evaluator:** Implements key Lisp functions (`define`, `lambda`, `if`, etc.) with arithmetic and comparison operations.
- **Environment:** Manages variable scope with nested support.
- **REPL:** Interactive, multi-line capable, with immediate result display and simple exit commands.

```
zisp>(+ (* 2 3) (- 10 5))  
Result: -9

zisp>(define x 5)    
Result: 5

zisp>(define square (lambda (n) (* n n)))
Result: <lambda with 1 params>

zisp>(if (> 10 5) (* 2 3) (+ 1 1))
Result: 6

zisp>(begin (define y 10) (* y 2))  
Result: 20
```
