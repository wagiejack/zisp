zig build run
```

```

This version uses emojis for a more engaging look, incorporates symbols for status indicators, and improves the structure for better readability on GitHub. Remember, however, that GitHub might render emojis differently depending on the user's environment, so it's good to keep this in mind when choosing to use them.
